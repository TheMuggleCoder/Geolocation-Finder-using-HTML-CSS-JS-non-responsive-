<h1>GeoSeek</h1> 
<h3></h3>A Geolocation finder using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript involves leveraging the Geolocation API provided by the modern web browsers. This API allows you to request the user's location and then use that information to display their position by showing their coordinates ( latitude and longitude ).</h3>

Below is a step-by-step guide to create a simple geolocation finder:
1. Basic HTML structure - Start wih a simple HTML file to create the structure of web page.
2. CSS for Styling - Create a CSS file link it with HTML for basic styling as well as putting a background image.
3. Javascript for Geolocation - Create a js file and add fucntionality.

When the "Locate Me" button is clicked, the browser requests the user's location, and if granted, displays the coordinates of longitute and latitude of the user's location.

Hope you enjoy finding your location coordinates !
